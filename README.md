## RoachPack

Hello! We are a group of Graduate students at NC State University, or to be more specific, we are dreamers who want to be pioneers of the Computer Science world.
Consider this homework to be one of our many steps at achieving our dreams! :wink:  

### Why RoachPack?
Good question!  
We are international students, visiting the United States for the first time. We all live near the Centinnial campus of NC State University.  
Our eyes ready to take in the grandeur and technological advancements of the United States, we were rather welcomed by a group of Anthropods which we all are afraid of.  
Yup, you guessed it right. Cockroaches!  
To overcome this fear and to take on challenges, we have named our group **RoachPack**! :muscle:

## Meet our team

He is also our group liaison! :sunglasses:

He is proficient and well-versed with the .NET Framework, which he claims to be highly relevant and at par with the newer technologies. Let's just respect his ancient age and agree with him for now. *-laughs in Python-*
